# InstagramHomeFeedClone
This project is a clone of Instagram Home Feed using Storyboard and minimalistic code written in Swift4. This project is a part of whole Instagram clone I am working on. I felt HomeFeed is one of the difficult screens to build and so I made it as a separate project. Instagram Clone A-Z will be pushed in my profile soon

It mainly covers topics like:
1) Adding a UICollectionView inside the header of UICollectionView.
2) Dynamic Cell height of UICollectionViewCell.
3) Using Parse to fetch objects.
4) Proper MVC pattern.
